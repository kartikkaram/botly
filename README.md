## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Dynamic LLM Prompting

Botly leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to enhance the contextual relevance and factual accuracy of LLM responses. Upon receiving a user query, the system dynamically retrieves pertinent context vectors from a vectorized knowledge base (e.g., website embeddings, CSV data, or uploaded documents) using semantic search algorithms (such as cosine similarity over embeddings generated by transformer-based models). The retrieved context is then injected into the prompt as system or context messages, enabling the LLM (e.g., Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek) to ground its generation in up-to-date, domain-specific information. This hybrid approach mitigates hallucinations, supports long-tail queries, and enables scalable, domain-adaptive conversational AI.

Key components:
- **Vector Store:** Contextual data is embedded and indexed for efficient similarity search.
- **Retriever:** On each user input, the retriever fetches top-k relevant context snippets.
- **Prompt Composer:** Dynamically constructs LLM prompts by concatenating retrieved context with user queries.
- **LLM Integration:** Supports multiple LLM backends, with context window management and fallback strategies.

This RAG pipeline ensures that Botly delivers accurate, context-aware, and up-to-date responses tailored to each user interaction.
